    "# Chapter 17: Solve Linear Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a self-contained chapter describing how to use Python to solve systems of linear equations.  It does not assume any experience with Python, and provides all the basic steps.  It is also a Jupyter notebook, which means if you edit it with Visual Studio Code (or other suitable IDE) then you can run the code directly.  Alternatively, you can run Python in a terminal as explained below and copy and paste the commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have $N$ unknown variables which we collect in a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}=[x_1, x_2, ..., x_N]$.  Further assume we have $N$ independent linear equations in these unknown variables.  These equations can be organized into the following standard form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\boldsymbol{x} = \\boldsymbol{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is a $N\\times N$ square matrix containing the coefficients of $\\boldsymbol{x}$, and $\\boldsymbol{b}$ is a length $N$ vector containing constants in these equations.  Both $A$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}$ are known.  If $A$ is full rank, this matrix equation can be solved by left multiplying by the inverse of $A$ to give:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{x} = A^{-1} \\boldsymbol{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for large matrices this is inefficient and there are much faster numerical methods to solve systems of linear equations.  In Matlab one would use `A\\b`.  In Python it is not much harder.  We will use the Numpy [linalg.solve()](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.solve.html) function to solve a linear system of equations.\n",
    "___\n",
    "## 2. Set up Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  In Windows, type `python` in a PowerShell, and if it is not installed, this will take you to the Windows Store to install Python.  After it runs, type: `exit()` to quit.\n",
    "2. Next, ensure you have Numpy installed.  If you are a more advanced Python user, installing it in a virtual environments is recommended as described in [Chapter 12](Chapter_12_Virtual_Environments.md), but for simplicity you can directly install Numpy (or confirm that it is already installed) with the following command in a terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python -m pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: the `$` is not typed -- it simply indicates the terminal prompt, which could be something like this `PS C:\\Users\\dmorris` in a Windows PowerShell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. You are now ready to run Python in a terminal window which you can do as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python\n",
    "Python 3.9.5 (tags/v3.9.5:0a7dcbd, May  3 2021, 17:27:52) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
