    "## Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays provide significant computational efficiencies over lists.  Consider various ways to represent 3D points, such as those collected from a lidar.  A single point could be represented as a class with a `.x`, `.y`, `.z`, or as a list with 3 elements or as a 1D numpy array with 3 elements.  A point cloud could then be either a list of points or a 2D numpy array which stacks 1D point arrays.  Performing an operation over all the points, such as rotating them, could be done by iterating over the list or else as a matrix multiplication applied to the array.  Both are equivalent mathematically, and lists are more flexible, but array operations are faster.  For operations on just a few points (10s or so), which representation you use does not make too much difference.  When there are 10,000 or 100,000 points, which could be a single lidar scan, then array operations could be orders of magnitude faster.  In addition, Numpy and other packages supply operations that are very efficient over arrays and much slower over lists.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays enable you to perform many operations directly on arrays without iterating.  This is important as iterating in Python is slow.  The following exercises should all be done without any iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In an interactive Python environment, create a `6x8` 2D array called `img` in which each element value is its index (see below).  You can do this using the `np.arange()` function that is just like Python's `range()` function except that it returns a 1D numpy array.  Then you can reshape it into the size of your target array using `.reshape( (H,W) )`.  The argument to this is a tuple with the height and width.  You should be able to do all this in one line of code and then your `img` for a `6x8` array should look like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7],\n",
    "       [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],\n",
    "       [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23],\n",
    "       [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31],\n",
    "       [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39],\n",
    "       [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. In one Python line of code, use integer division to transform `img` into an array called `row` with each element equal to its row index, like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "       [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n",
    "       [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n",
    "       [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n",
    "       [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n",
    "       [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]], dtype=int32)\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Similarly use one Python line of code to transform `img` into an array called `col` with each element equal to its column index, like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n",
    "       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n",
    "       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n",
    "       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n",
    "       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n",
    "       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]], dtype=int32)\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Use simple math operations applied to `row` and `col` to calculate a distance array called `dist` that gives the Euclidean distance to each element from the top-left element.   You can use Pythagorous theorem for this: `c = np.sqrt(a*a+b*b)`. To display it in an easily viewable 3-decimal point format use the following commands:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> np.set_printoptions(formatter={'float': '{: 0.3f}'.format})\n",
    ">>> dist\n",
    "array([[ 0.000,  1.000,  2.000,  3.000,  4.000,  5.000,  6.000,  7.000],\n",
    "       [ 1.000,  1.414,  2.236,  3.162,  4.123,  5.099,  6.083,  7.071],\n",
    "       [ 2.000,  2.236,  2.828,  3.606,  4.472,  5.385,  6.325,  7.280],\n",
    "       [ 3.000,  3.162,  3.606,  4.243,  5.000,  5.831,  6.708,  7.616],\n",
    "       [ 4.000,  4.123,  4.472,  5.000,  5.657,  6.403,  7.211,  8.062],\n",
    "       [ 5.000,  5.099,  5.385,  5.831,  6.403,  7.071,  7.810,  8.602]])\n",
    ">>> np.set_printoptions(formatter={}) # Undo the format option for future display\n",
    "```\n",
    "5.  Find the [Manhatten distance or Taxicab distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) from each element of `img` to the center of the center point `(2.5,3.5)`.  This is simply the absolute row difference plus the absolute column difference of each element from the center point.  The `abs()` function will help you here.  You should get a result like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "array([[6., 5., 4., 3., 3., 4., 5., 6.],\n",
    "       [5., 4., 3., 2., 2., 3., 4., 5.],\n",
    "       [4., 3., 2., 1., 1., 2., 3., 4.],\n",
    "       [4., 3., 2., 1., 1., 2., 3., 4.],\n",
    "       [5., 4., 3., 2., 2., 3., 4., 5.],\n",
    "       [6., 5., 4., 3., 3., 4., 5., 6.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "6.  Given two 1D arrays: `vec1 = np.array([1,2,3])`, and `vec2 = np.array([2,2,1,1])`, use the muliplcation operator in one line of code to calculate the outer product of these.  You'll need to transform `vec1` into a column vector before multiplying, and the answer you should get is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "array([[2, 2, 1, 1],\n",
    "       [4, 4, 2, 2],\n",
    "       [6, 6, 3, 3]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "7. Use the commands `np.zeros()`, `np.eye()`, `np.concatenate()` and `.astype()` in one line of code to create the following matrix:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "array([[0., 0., 0.],\n",
    "       [1., 0., 0.],\n",
    "       [0., 1., 0.],\n",
